In this repo, I include the code I wrote every week for the Air Quality IS. I numbered my code chronologically, based on the week I created it (ie IS_Deliverable1 is week 1). Below, I include descriptions of the different files. 

- .rmd files : These are R Markdown files. They are the original files. 

- .md files : Markdown files. I had converted my .rmd files to markdown to make them neater and easier to read. The markdown files have their corresponding images in their folders. 

- folders : The folders were generated to hold the images of the markdown files. 

- csvs. 
  - Currently, is2.csv is the csv I've been using most frequently, it has sn62 data from July 2019 to around March. 
  - isfull.csv was also sn62, but its timeframe extends to April. 
  - isfinal.csv was the sn62 data, but extracted as final instead of raw from the QuantAQ website.

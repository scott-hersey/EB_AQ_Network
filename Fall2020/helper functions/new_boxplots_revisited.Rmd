# Motivation 

The upwind-downwind definitions that we created this semester were a rough approximation of wind directions that were lacking because they include wind directions that shouldn't be included in downwind and are not including other wind directions that it should. If you look at a given polar plot, you'll see that downwind wind direction changes as a function of wind speed. 

In this notebook, we will try different methods of creating a boxplot and of defining downwind, in order to give a more accurate representation. 

# Trying a smaller range for upwind-downwind 

This will solve one of the sources of the problem, but not the other 

# Trying a different upwind-downwind definition 

For this I will initially test on SN45 CO. The SN45 CO polar plot shows that downwind range changes in an "L" shape.

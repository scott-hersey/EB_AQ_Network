# EB_AQ_Network
Data analysis for the East Boston Air Quality Network of QuantAQ Nodes

## About the project
We are analyzing data from QuantAQ sensors being deployed in East Boston in order to draw conclusions about the effect of airport activity on local air quality.

This work currently involves the following components:
- Importing and cleaning necessary data, such as meteorological and sensor data
- Colocation between instrument-grade sensors and QuantAQ sensors

## Navigating the repo

- The most up-to-date work done on **cleaning the data** can be found in the initial walkthrough RMD file (./initial_analysis_walkthrough.Rmd)
- The most up-to-date work done on **colocation** can be found in the colocation walkthrough file (./colocation_walkthrough.Rmd)
- Work from previous semesters is stored in the deprecated branch.

## Reading files

The walkthrough files were created as Rmd, and intended to read on Rstudio. In order to read them as such, we recommend:

1. Downloading R studio
2. Cloning this repo
3. Opening the .rproj file (./EB_AQ_Network.Rproj), which should open Rstudio
4. Opening the desired file inside Rstudio

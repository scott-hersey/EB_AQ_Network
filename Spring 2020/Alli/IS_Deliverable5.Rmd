### Setup and Preprocessing 
#### Including Necessary Libraries

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
library(openair)
```
#### Importing Data and Setting Up Workspace
```{r}
#setting workspace
#setwd(choose.dir())
#next we import the data 
sn62 = read.csv("is2.csv", header = TRUE)

#this time I'm inporting data up until today as well
sn62_full = read.csv("IS_full.csv", header=TRUE)
```


#### Formatting 
```{r}
#changing the datetime format 
sn62$timestamp <- ymd_hms(sn62$timestamp)
#renaming the datasets, because openair needs a "date" column
#also setting wind_speed and wind_direction to ws and wd, b/c of wind rose function 
sn62 <- sn62 %>%
  rename(date = timestamp, ws = wind_speed, wd = wind_dir) 
#set the date column as the first column in the dataframe, for openair formatting
sn62[1] <- sn62$date

```
```{r}
#doing the same for the full dataset
sn62_full$timestamp <- ymd_hms(sn62_full$timestamp)
sn62_full <- sn62_full %>%
  rename(date = timestamp, ws = wind_speed, wd = wind_dir) 
sn62_full[1] <- sn62_full$date
```
#### Filtering 
```{r}
sn62 <- dplyr::filter(sn62, between(sn62$wd, 0, 360))
sn62 <-dplyr::filter(sn62, between(sn62$ws, 0, 30))
sn62 <-dplyr::filter(sn62, between(sn62$pressure, 98000, 120000))
sn62 <- dplyr::filter(sn62, between(sn62$temp_manifold, -10, 40))

```
```{r}
sn62_full <- dplyr::filter(sn62_full, between(sn62_full$wd, 0, 360))
sn62_full <-dplyr::filter(sn62_full, between(sn62_full$ws, 0, 30))
sn62_full <-dplyr::filter(sn62_full, between(sn62_full$pressure, 98000, 120000))
sn62_full <- dplyr::filter(sn62_full, between(sn62_full$temp_manifold, -10, 40))

```
## Defining normal for the bin data 
Last week, I was looking at techniques to extrapolate average data for a given time interval. After talking to Scott, this week I will try approximating normal for the bin data by answering two questions:

1. What are the general ranges of different bins?

2. What are trends in ratios of small:large, small:medium particles?

##### Question 1: What are the general ranges?
I think I can answer this question with varying levels of precision. 

First, we can just calculate what the min and max are for each bin. 
```{r}
apply(sn62[26:40],2,min)
```
```{r}
apply(sn62[26:40],2,max)
```
```{r}
apply(sn62[26:40],2,mean)
```

Like before, I can calculate the seasonal and monthly averages. I believe that in this cause, averages are better, because there is the risk of outliers in this dataset. 

```{r}
## calculate monthly means
monthly <- timeAverage(sn62, avg.time = "month")
#calculating seasonal means
seasonaly <- timeAverage(sn62, avg.time = "quarter")
monthly_cleared <- subset(monthly, select=c(1,25:40))
monthly_cleared
```

Wow, all the bin data from July is significantly higher than the rest of the months. Let's see what happens to the statistics when the July data is taken out

```{r}
noJuly <- selectByDate(sn62, month = c("January", "February","August", "September", "October", "November", "December"))
#apply(noJuly[26:40],2,min)
apply(noJuly[26:40],2,max)
#apply(noJuly[26:40],2,mean)
```

These numbers are a lot lower. And, like in earlier deliverables, the maximum for the bin data decreases and bin number increases


### Ratios

What are trends in ratios of small:large, small:medium particles?
This seems to be a two part analysis :
First, I'll have to create two variables the represent the two ratios 
Then, I'll determine the trends by plotting the ratios
```{r}
sn62$small_large_ratio <- sn62$bin0/sn62$bin14
sn62$small_medium_ratio <- sn62$bin0/sn62$bin7
```
```{r}
#timePlot(sn62$small_medium_ratio)
#timePlot(sn62$small_large_ratio)
timePlot(sn62, pollutant= c("small_medium_ratio", "small_large_ratio"), log=TRUE)
```
They differ by some orders of magnitude. The ratio between small and large data is about two magnitudes greater than small to medium. 

## Going back and Making Sense of Binned Data 

Another goal I had for this week was to go back to plots like WindRose, and PollutionRose - visualizations that show data in different bins- and finally make them mean something. Up until now, the bins were different sizes, and the top bin always seemed to be really huge. Because of this, it was hard to say anything conclusive about the plots. Now, however, I have figured out a way to make equally sized bins and can hopefully finally make quality plots. Below I include all of the graphs that bin data that I had tried to make in the past, this time, changing the bin size. 

#### WindRose

```{r}
breaks1 = c(0,0.25*max(sn62$ws), 0.5*max(sn62$ws), 0.75*max(sn62$ws), max(sn62$ws))
windRose(sn62, breaks = breaks1)
windRose(sn62, type="month", breaks = breaks1)
windRose(sn62, type="weekday", breaks = breaks1)
```
It seems like lower speed winds are most common, and West and SouthWest wind directions are most common. This doesn't change for the days of the week. This also doesn't change for all the months, except July, when the wind is strongest from the North East. This actually seems like its correlated with the percentile rose data later on, and the mean bin0 data earlier on!!! The highest bin0 data was consistently in July, and the direction that's associated with the highest bin0 data is North East. And this shows that the highest bin0 data is associated with Northeast winds that happen in July. 

#### PollutionRose

```{r}
breaks2 = c(0,0.25*max(sn62$bin0), 0.5*max(sn62$bin0), 0.75*max(sn62$bin0), max(sn62$bin0))
breaks3 = c(0,(1/8)*max(sn62$bin0), (2/8)*max(sn62$bin0), (3/8)*max(sn62$bin0),
            (1/2)*max(sn62$bin0),(5/8)*max(sn62$bin0),(6/8)*max(sn62$bin0),
            (7/8)*max(sn62$bin0)
            )

breaks4 = c(0,(1/16)*max(sn62$bin0), (2/16)*max(sn62$bin0), (3/16)*max(sn62$bin0),
            (4/16)*max(sn62$bin0),(5/16)*max(sn62$bin0),(6/16)*max(sn62$bin0),
            (7/16)*max(sn62$bin0),
           (8/16)*max(sn62$bin0), (9/16)*max(sn62$bin0), (10/16)*max(sn62$bin0),
            (11/16)*max(sn62$bin0),(12/16)*max(sn62$bin0),(13/16)*max(sn62$bin0),
            (14/16)*max(sn62$bin0), (15/16)*max(sn62$bin0)
            )

pollutionRose(sn62, pollutant  = "bin0",breaks=breaks2)
pollutionRose(sn62, pollutant  = "bin0",breaks=breaks3)
pollutionRose(sn62, pollutant  = "bin0",breaks=breaks4)
pollutionRose(sn62, pollutant  = "bin0",breaks=breaks2, type = "weekday")
```
Oh, one interesting thing is that it has to include the whole dataset. for example, if you make your last break go to 1/2, then that chunk will be 1/2 to the max value. 

!! Update: below, I tried to create a new dataset that only continued smaller data, but after talking with Scott, I realize this is not a good idea. 

```{r}

#new_df <- [sn62$wd[order(sn62$wd)], sn62$wd[order(sn62$wd)], sn62$bin0[order(sn62$bin0)]]

#test1<- sn62$wd[order(sn62$wd)]
#test1<- test1[1:.25*length(sn62$wd)]
#test1 <- test1 %>%
#  slice(1:.25*length(sn62$wd))
```

Otherwise, this is still not at the right bin size to analyze, so I will not do any analysis yet. 

#### PolarPlot

```{r}
breaks2 = c(0,0.25*max(sn62$bin0), 0.5*max(sn62$bin0), 0.75*max(sn62$bin0), max(sn62$bin0))
polarPlot(sn62, pollutant = "bin0", k=80, breaks=breaks2,  smooth  =TRUE)
```
Breaks don't work for PolarPlot, because there's no binned data! 

#### PercentileRose

```{r}
percentileRose(sn62, pollutant = "bin0", smooth  =TRUE)
```
So, if I'm reading this correctly, most of the high value bin0 data is coming from the North East. I'll have to look into this more.

## Correlations between binned data and CO (for aircraft activity)


```{r}
timePlot(sn62, pollutant = c("bin0", "co_we"), group=TRUE)
timePlot(sn62, pollutant = c("bin0", "co_we"), group=TRUE, log=TRUE)
```
I tried graphing bin0 and co data, to see if there's any correlation between the two as a function of time. It doesn't seem to be a good approach, because the scales of the two are too different. Later, Scott suggested that I could plot bin0 as a function of co, which I'll do in a later notebook. 

```{r}
corPlot(sn62)
```
This graph is too dense, so I'm only including variables that I think could be important to analyze, and excluding the rest. 

```{r}
binandtemp <- sn62[,c(7,13:27)]
corPlot(binandtemp)
```

Above, I used corPlot, which makes a matrix of outputs of correlations between the row and column variables. From this matrix, it doesn't look like there's a strong correlation between CO and binned data. 

#### Geographic analysis of bin data 

I guess there's no geographic equivalent to polarplot or something, so you can't really overlay the graph with a map.
I guess I could just do what Scott did and compare the map with the graph, side by side.

<!-- ![google maps of the sensor location](C:\Users\abusa\Documents\GitHub\EB_AQ_Network\Alli\theplace.PNG)-->

(NOTE: I didn't get to do the analysis of this, as I had hoped to, but I will in later notebooks.)

## Part 4: See what effect corona virus had on the data 

```{r}
timePlot(sn62_full, pollutant = c("bin0", "bin1"), group=TRUE, log=TRUE)
```


It doesn't look like there's a significant difference between bin data pre-corona outbreak and post-corona outbreak.
